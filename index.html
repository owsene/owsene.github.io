            <p>
                Hi, my name is Emma Owsen. This is my final year in the Design major, I have finished a minor in Psychology and I’m expecting to graduate in the summer. One of my main interests in design is web and mobile design, and while I have designed and created prototypes for it, I have never done much HTML before, except in a high school class and I barely remember anything from it. So, I think it will be interesting to see what the process is like to making and designing for a functional webpage in HTML and CSS.
                <br>
                Beyond this class, I am starting to gain interest in digital illustration and painting, which I’m really terrible at. Some random facts about me is that I’m left-handed, vegetarian, my favorite color is pink, my favorite music artist is Poppy, I love video games, sleeping, and I love cats. I don’t like taking pictures of myself so I have a pic of my cat, her name is Baby Kit and she’s the best cat ever:
